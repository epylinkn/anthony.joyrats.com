IN DREAMS is a performance and full-body instrument exploring skating
as it is in my dreams...
    without gravity
    without endings
    and, most importantly, without bruises.

## Inspiration

For whatever reasons, I was never really excelled at skateboarding when I was younger. Yet, my imagination was wild with possibilities. I set out to bring that imagination to life.

Deep down, this instrument explores my anxiety and shyness. And so composed the music and designed the instrument to force myself to play loudly. Here, it is performed live using a custom instrument designed to encourage large gestures, taking up space, and a joyful smile. The instrument was developed for New Instruments for Musical Expression.
